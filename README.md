# Steiner-Tree

A program to solve the ST problem using The Prim algorithm, exploring all the
combinations of the solutions to prove the inefficient of this types of strategies. The Prim's algorithm will be
developed using a greedy search, using a adjacency matrix to represent a bidirectional graph. I will
solve this problem using all combinations of optional vertices, keeping fixed a number of mandatory
vertices.
